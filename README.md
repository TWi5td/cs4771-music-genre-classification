# Music Genre Classification (CS 4771 Project)

This project explores machine learning techniques for **classifying music genres** based on audio features.  
The work is part of **CS 4771: Undergraduate Machine Learning Project**.

---

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build models that can automatically classify songs into genres such as rock, pop, jazz, and classical.  
Applications include:
- Music recommendation systems
- Playlist organization
- Streaming platform personalization

---

## Machine Learning Tasks
- **Baseline models:** Logistic Regression, k-NN, Random Forest on extracted audio features.  
- **Deep learning model:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on spectrogram images.
